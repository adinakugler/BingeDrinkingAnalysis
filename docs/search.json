    "text": "1 Introduction\nWelcome to our project about visualizing binge drinking in the united states. We chose this project because binge drinking is often portrayed as a regular occurrence in the life of Americans (especially grad students) and we thought that it would be interesting if we could visualize binge drinking trends across the country.\nAccording to the CDC, Binge drinking is defined as consuming 5 or more drinks on an occasion for men and 4 or more drinks on an occasion for women. Officially, it’s consuming alcohol that brings a person’s blood alcohol level to over 0.08%, which averages to the amount stated above. Binge drinking is not uniform across age groups, income levels, geographical location, etc.\nSome areas in the Untied States have reputations for higher rates of binge drinking, like around college campuses. Other regions are known as living healthier lifestyles where drinking is not as prevalent. A state like Utah has a large population of people that do not drink alcohol for religious regions. While Tennessee is known for having their own type of alcohol (Whiskey). Some areas in the US are known to have specific reputations and it is interesting to note how these reputations correspond to actual binge drinking rates.\nWe would like to answer questions such as in which regions is binge drinking more prevalent. This might provide insight over cultural differences in approaches to drinking across states/regions. Another similar question would be does lower population increase likelihood of binge drinking. This is an interesting question because it is a commonly held opinion that binge drinking is more common in small towns because “there is nothing to do”. Finally we could also find temperature data for these states and see if there’s any variation in binge drinking tendencies based on climate information."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data, 500 Cities: Binge drinking among adults aged &gt;= 18, is from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is a United States federal agency within Health and Human Services. It specifically represents the percentage of adults that partake in binge drinking in 500 US cities. While it is a study of 500 cities, there are more than just 500 unique identifiers in the data. This is because, each city is divided into a more specific Census Tract if relevant, so there could be multiple rows representing different parts of the same city, however there will not be any overlap in boundries. There are over 28,000 unique areas in the data. The sources of data used were based on government data collection methods, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2017, 2010 Census, and American Community Survey 2013-2017 estimates. This data specifically uses the Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System. Each of these estimates are federally funded projects used to gather data on the US population. Specifically, these use exact measures for locations that can be uniform and therefore combined to form the dataset. Each method of collection occurs at a relatively frequent basis. The specific project for the data is the 500 Cities project in 2017. The binge drinking data is just a subset of this larger dataset that was compiled by the CDC. The data provides estimates for crude or age-adjusted percentage of adults that partake in binge drinking. The percentage is based on the locality population size. The data is not updated until a more recent study is performed.\nThe data is in tabular form, where each row’s unique identifier is the Unique Id, which is the census level region. Other columns include geographic columns like State, City, type of geological indicator (City or Tract), and GeoLocation. Many columns are not useful since it a subset of a larger dataset. These include Year, DataSource, Category, as well as some others. These are all the same for all rows as it was the way they could be filtered from the original data. For example, the year for all the data is 2017. The main column of data that will be the focus is the DataValue column. This is the percent of the population that partakes in binge drinking. The Data_Value_Type column indicates where the data value is the crude prevalence or age adjusted prevalence. The crude prevalence is used in most of the rows. The prevalence confidence interval is also given as it is an estimate. The population for each area is also available in the data set. There are 29,006 rows. There are 24 columns, yet about half will be removed due to repeated information. There is a column that notes that the data is suppressed for the prevalence due to the population being too small to make an estimate. The dataset was combined with a simple dataset that mapped the states to a region by the Census. Additionally, we added a dataset that had the ages for each states and this came directly from the Census. We averaged the age groups based on the population provided to get the average age for each state. We merged these values into our dataset.\nThe primary data source is https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Binge-drinking-among-adults-aged-18-yea/gqat-rcqz\nThe Ages Data https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2017/state/asrh/ The Regions was found from a GitHub Page and verified based on official Census Bureau Reigons https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2017/state/asrh/"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nThe research plan is to visualize the prevalence of binge drinking. To do this, geographical data can be used for this visualization. Prevalence of adults that binge drink will be the target variable on the visualizations. Since there is a large amount of geographical data, including mapping of the prevalence can be done. A map colored with a continuous color pallet based on prevalence of binge drinking would be an important visualization to identify nationwide trends. This map will be done on the statewide level. The data is able to create these maps because geographic data is present. This will allow the research and exploration to be completed in a mapping format. Additionally, trends on a larger scale can be done by categorizing each place as a one of the four regions in the US (West, Midwest, Northeast, South) and plotting different visuals like bar charts, histograms, and boxplots. Age and population data will be combined and summarized for each state. These values are to be compared with the state prevalence of binge drinking. Our interactive competents will incorporate a scatterplot for each of these. Therefore,heatmaps and density contour lines can be used to analyze the relationship between these variables."

In this graph, we see that all the regions have distributions that are approximately normal, however the West is a little narrower and the Northeast seems to be right skewed. To further test this theory, we conduct a schapiro-wilk test for each region.\n\n\nCode\nMidwest &lt;- states|&gt;filter(Region=='Midwest')|&gt;select(meanPrv)\nshapiro.test(Midwest$meanPrv)\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  Midwest$meanPrv\nW = 0.93995, p-value = 0.4974\n\n\nCode\nNortheast &lt;- states|&gt;filter(Region=='Northeast')|&gt;select(meanPrv)\nshapiro.test(Northeast$meanPrv)\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  Northeast$meanPrv\nW = 0.85843, p-value = 0.09218\n\n\nCode\nSouth &lt;- states|&gt;filter(Region=='South')|&gt;select(meanPrv)\nshapiro.test(South$meanPrv)\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  South$meanPrv\nW = 0.9729, p-value = 0.867\n\n\nCode\nWest &lt;- states|&gt;filter(Region=='West')|&gt;select(meanPrv)\nshapiro.test(West$meanPrv)\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  West$meanPrv\nW = 0.95663, p-value = 0.7012\n\n\nThe shapiro-wilks test was tested on the mean prevalence for each state for each region. This is because there was too much data to test normality based on counties. As we can see, we can not reject the assumption that these distributions are normal since their p-values lie above the 0.05 threshhold. It should be noted however that the northeast was close, and would have been rejected under a higher significance level (10%), but for our current parameters, we will say that all our distributions are normal or approximately normal.\n\n\nCode\n# By state\nggplot(states, aes(x = meanPrv)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), color = \"lightsteelblue4\",\n                 fill = \"lightskyblue1\", binwidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_function(fun = dnorm, col = \"mediumvioletred\",\n                  args = list(mean(states$meanPrv), sd(states$meanPrv)),\n                  lwd = 1) +\n  geom_density(col=\"saddlebrown\", lwd = 1)+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Mean Binge Drinking Percentage of All States\",\n       x=\"Mean Prevalence of Binge Drinking (%)\",\n       y= \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting mean prevalence of each State gives a roughly normal distribution but with the existence of gaps and multiple different peaks puts this hypothesis in question. So we test this using a schapiro-wilk test.\n\n\nCode\nshapiro.test(states$meanPrv)\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  states$meanPrv\nW = 0.98947, p-value = 0.9288\n\n\nThe null hypothesis can not be rejected. Therefore the normality assumption of the data can be given for mean prevalence of binge drinking per state. This makes sense since the expected value of means is meant to converge to a normal distribution\n\n\n3.1.2 Boxplots\n\n\nCode\n# all\nggplot(combined, aes(x=BingeDrinkingPrv, y=Region, fill=Region))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Binge Drinking Across US Cities and Localities by Region\",\n       x=\"Prevalence of Binge Drinking (%)\")\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.564\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we are interested in the distribution of binge drinking by region, we first facet and draw ridgeline boxplots. We can see that the top 3 regions have similar peaking modes, but the midwest seems to be slightly shifted to the right. We can also see that all the regions have a wide spread with a significant amount of outliers."

We note that the highest percentages correspond with the northern areas of the country, which are usually colder. This could imply a correlation between binge drinking and weather, but that would need to be explored further with an additional data set of the weather in the 50 states. The main issue with choropleths is that a larger shaded area doesn’t necessarily mean that there are more binge drinkers in general, its just a calculation of the percentage relative to the population, and we show that difference by including an additional choropleth for population spread and note that there isn’t much overlap between population size and binge percentage. We also include one for ages, and we see a slight negative correlation where the areas with lower ages correspond to higher average drinking rates and vice versa, but its difficult to tell just by looking at two seperate graphs."

    "text": "Through our exploration of binge drinking behaviors across the country we have gained many insights. We know that binge drinking trends are normally distributed. We also know that some regions in the US have different behaviors than others, specifically that the Midwest consistently displays higher than average binge drinking prevalence rates than other regions. When exploring age and population, there does not seem to be any type of correlation between them and binge drinking. However, we only had access to the average age of each state which doesn’t necessarily imply a lack of correlation between age in general and drinking, which would require a completely different data sets. Similarly, population was used as a proxy for the size and livelihood of the states which isn’t necessarily true. In the future, this project could be improved with the incorporation of several different variables such as climate and amount of colleges/bars in the area, and the ability to explore binge drinking habits for individual age groups as well as cities/regions."
