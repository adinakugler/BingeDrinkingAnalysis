# Binge Drinking Analysis
This is an analysis project of Binge Drinking prevalence in the United States created by Adina Kugler and Selim Shaalan. We start by looking at the distribution of binge drinking through the states. Through different visualizations in R and D3, we explore the relationship between binge drinking compared to the average age and total population per state.
